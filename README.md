Overview

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront powered by Node and MySQL. For customers, the bamazon app takes in orders, calculates price, and depletes stock from the store's inventory.

For managers, the bamazon app views inventory, filters inventory by low stock, restocks, and adds new products.

Walkthrough

Customer

Opening, running, and editing the app requires terminal, node, MySQL, and inquirer npm.

Enter in 'cd' + the folder location. Then run node bamazonCustomer.js

The terminal inquirer will ask you what is the item ID of the item you'd like to buy and also the amount of that item you want to purchase.

Upon completion. You will get a confirmation message that the purchase was made. Then you will see the updated inventory and the amount of money spent.

Manager

Opening, running, and editing the app requires terminal, node, MySQL, and inquirer npm.

Enter in 'cd' + the folder location. Then run node bamazonManager.js

The terminal inquirer will ask you "what would you like to do". Depending on your answer, 4 different functions may occur. You can view all inventory, view low inventory, restock individual items, and add a new item to the inventory.
